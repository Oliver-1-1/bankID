Swedish bankID api calls and authentication using c++.
Animated qr codes has timing issues and therefor only works after a few retries. 
The auth and collect process works as intended. Left to add on those is Error codes handler.

Testing drawing a circle(SFML) on a rasberry pi i noticed it took way too much memory and will have to port it to a website.
